              Hello, as stated my name is Norman. I started learning Front-End development a few years ago and
              enjoy coding and creating content. I am self-taught in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, including Bootstraps
              and jQuery. I have some experience with API, JSON, and Firebase and am always looking to learn more.
              I have learned from online-courses at Codecademy, Udemy, Lynda, and freecodecamp.com. I attended
              college in Waco, TX at Texas State Technical College (TSTC), for Automotive Technology. I have been
              in Technical Support roles for most of my career. I started learning Web Development and enjoyed
              what I was learning, and what the learning programs had me create. I aim to be a Senior Front End
              Developer one day and move to Full Stack Developer.
